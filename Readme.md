# Risk–Reward Optimization Using Q-Learning

## Overview

This project is a **Reinforcement Learning simulation** where an agent plays a **coin-flip betting game**. The agent starts with a fixed amount of coins and chooses how much to bet each round. Based on wins and losses, the agent learns over time to maximize its total coins.

The game demonstrates how an agent can **learn risk-aware decision-making** purely from trial and error, without any prior knowledge.

## Features

- Custom coin-flip betting environment
- Discrete bet amounts `[0, 1, 2, 5]`
- Tracks wins and losses over multiple rounds
- Agent learns optimal betting strategy through repeated play

## Goal

Maximize the total coins after a set number of rounds by learning **when to take risks and when to play safe**.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the environment to play manually or train the RL agent  
3. Observe how the agent’s decisions improve over time
